Hello everyone,
Welcome to my profile.
I am Naser, I have studied Computer Engineering, and I am also interested in studying Software Engineering.
At university, I encountered Android programming and learned the two essential languages for Android development: Kotlin and Java. Android programming was so fascinating to me that I have planned to pursue it as my future career to become an Android developer.
My expertise is in developing Android applications using Kotlin and Java, and I have experience working with tools like Android Studio, Git, RESTful APIs, and Firebase. During my career, I have worked on various projects from user interface design (UI/UX) to app performance optimization.
I am looking for new opportunities to apply my skills and professional development in the field of Android programming. With the experience and technical knowledge I have, I hope I can achieve more growth and success in Android projects.</p>
